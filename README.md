# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a small project I built as part of The Odin Project.  
It’s like an Etch-a-Sketch where you can draw by moving your mouse over a grid.

## What it does

- Creates a default 16x16 grid of square divs
- Squares turn black when you hover over them
- You can click a button to choose a new grid size (up to 100)

## What I used

- HTML
- CSS (with Flexbox)
- JavaScript (DOM + events)

## How to try it

1. Open the page in a browser
2. Hover over the grid to draw
3. Click the “Resize Grid” button to change the size

This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, loops, and working with Flexbox.
